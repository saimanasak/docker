 #### Why Docker?? 
 - Generally, when we install a software we'll follow common steps: 
    - Download the installer
    - Run the installer
    - If any error is encountered during the process
    - Troubleshoot the error and fix it
    - Rerun the installer
- To solve such issue, **DOCKER** comes into play.
- In a simple way, Docker is an open platform. For suppose, once the build is done, we can run it anywhere on any platform.
